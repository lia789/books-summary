Scraping needed for accurate translation of expressions in 25 languages - Upwork
Data Extraction
Mon Nov 29 2021 08:57:56 (1 day)


Important mention: We DO NOT NEED A TRANSLATOR. We are looking for a SCRAPER.
We are looking for someone to help us scrape data matching our current database
of expression from specialized translation websites (examples of links below, but not limited to it) for the following languages:
Japanese
Korean
Hindi
Indonesian/ Bahasa
Spanish
Russian
Vietnamese
Portuguese
German
Thai
Polish
Romanian
Czech
Greek
Hungarian
Burmese
Persian
Tamil
Urdu
Bengali
It is important that the expressions will be translated as expressions (not definitions, not the sense of the expression etc.)
in the other language. This is why we are avoiding dictionaries and instead are looking for websites that are a bit more specialized,
where you could scrape the expressions as the actual translated expressions.
Places to look for :
From Proz.com , such as the example below:
https://www.proz.com/glossary-translations/english-to-italian-translations/idioms-maxims-sayings/page2
Matterhornlanguages
https://matterhornlanguages.com/german-idioms/
Looking forward to receiving your application.
As mentioned above, we DO NOT NEED A TRANSLATOR. We do need a SCRAPER.
