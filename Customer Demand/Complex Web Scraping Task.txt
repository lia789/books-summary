Geography: Israel
Industry:
-Internet
-Computer Software

Company Headcount

Scrape leboncoin.fr - Upwork
Data Extraction
Mon Nov 29 2021 07:53:17 (1 day)

I've a project to do a daily scraping of all the ads of leboncoin.fr, for the sections &quot;locations&quot;
(https://www.leboncoin.fr/locations/offres) and &quot;colocations&quot; (https://www.leboncoin.fr/colocations/offres).
The website have strong anti scraping technologies (like Datadome and captcha).
How much would it cost to do the settings ? And after this to how much the process would cost each month ?
The number of daily posted ads is huge (between 10 000 to 25 000) so you could scrape the website by regions instead of selecting all the country.

Help with some python / selenium scripts - Upwork
Script Automation

Hi,
I am trying to build a few bots in Python/Selenium, which the basics are working fine.
But at the moment stuck with some stuff and need someone who can guide/help me how to solve it.
This is not just a regular job to build a bot, its more a job to help me building the bot and explaining what to do. So for this case it's important that you speak english fluently.
It's marked as a single job, but probably it will be a few times per month where i need some help in developing bots.
Thanks!

Weather data scrapper - Upwork
Script Automation
Tue Nov 30 2021 02:03:53 (14 hours)


The objective of the mission is to create a scrapper with Python (bs4) that accepts as arguments :
- a location (a city)
- a date
And returns a dictionary with all the information available in the &quot;summary&quot; block on the wunderground website.
So, for example, by entering the variable &quot;Las Vegas&quot; and the date of October 30, 2021, the scrapper must return a Python dictionary with all the information contained in the summary block:
https://www.wunderground.com/history/daily/KVGT/date/2021-10-30
The script will be integrated into another script, so I don't need the ability to run it through the command prompt. In the end, I need to be able to put two arguments in the final function: city and date.
Price for the mission: $5
