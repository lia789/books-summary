Show your competency by creating a report for time block 61, making buckets between 23.270 and 23.320 for group 1 only..  This is a very small area of the potential full range.  Provide what you think buckets should look like for milestone 2 and 3 for the range I just mentioned.  Use a proximity of 0.003 for when a mandatory time is found.

Typically, Gird files come with about 3.6 Million outputs spread out over 300 Time Blocks.  Each Time Block has about 12,000 outputs.  Each group in a Time Block has about 4,000 outputs. So when your program searches one time block, it searches each group for matches, potentially searching up to 4,000 outputs at a time.

- To recognise a product page (looking for relevant info - price etc) 
- Automatically scrape the ÜRL, website name (usually from URL), title, image and price from page.

I am looking for a Python developer who is experienced in web scraping (using Scrapy module), big data analysis, and have a fair UI/UX design experience.  
 
You are required to crawl data from a specified target website (e.g. Amazon or TripAdvisor, or other if you are familiar with them, but Amazon is preferred) and visualize the data in a graphic user interface GUI. The data is then analyzed by the big data techniques (NLP is preferred, other is also acceptable if you can prove the complexity) 
 
Since I don’t specific too many details at the moment, you can introduce some idea if you can achieve it. Here is some of my suggestion. If NLP is used, you may determine if the comment is consistent to the grading. If clustering is used, you may determine if there is any anomaly user. It is important to show the the outcome of the techniques used is meaningful. 
 
In short, what you need to do is: 
(1)	Crawl the data from a target website and store it in a database 
(2)	Design a GUI and visualize the data retrieved from the database 
(3)	Apply big data techniques to the data

We have an exciting problem: scraping 5,000 - 7,000 rental agent websites in the Netherlands. 
 
To do this we've built a tool that allows you to rapidly create web scrapers. The tool is a Google Chrome Extension that you can install in your browser. Then, using a JSON configuration file you can rapidly build web scrapers. 
 
We're looking for people who are able to use this tool to build web scrapers for these rental agent websites. Preferably we would like to work long-term with someone, as getting to know the ins and outs of the tool might take a bit of work. 
 
As a try-out, we want to start with 5 hours of work, and if we're happy with the quality we can make a longer arrangement. 
 
Each rental agent website is slightly different, so we're looking for someone who is able to be creative and find solutions for each rental agent website. Being able to work precisely is a requirement as the data needs to be scraped exactly as it is stated on the website. 
 
Knowledge of the Dutch language is NOT required as our tool works great with Google Translate. 
 
Skills required: 
 - JSON 
 - HTML and CSS selectors. 
 - Regex (regular expressions). 
 
To get a better idea of how the tool works. 
You can find the documentation + video of our tool here:
