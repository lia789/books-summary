data, Help us build web scrapers ,"""👋 Hi Freelancers, 
 
We have an exciting problem: scraping 5,000 - 7,000 rental agent websites in the Netherlands. 
 
To do this we've built a tool that allows you to rapidly create web scrapers. The tool is a Google Chrome Extension that you can install in your browser. Then, using a JSON configuration file you can rapidly build web scrapers. 
 
We're looking for people who are able to use this tool to build web scrapers for these rental agent websites. Preferably we would like to work long-term with someone, as getting to know the ins and outs of the tool might take a bit of work. 
 
As a try-out, we want to start with 5 hours of work, and if we're happy with the quality we can make a longer arrangement. 
 
Each rental agent website is slightly different, so we're looking for someone who is able to be creative and find solutions for each rental agent website. Being able to work precisely is a requirement as the data needs to be scraped exactly as it is stated on the website. 
 
Knowledge of the Dutch language is NOT required as our tool works great with Google Translate. 
 
Skills required: 
 - JSON 
 - HTML and CSS selectors. 
 - Regex (regular expressions). 
 
To get a better idea of how the tool works. 
You can find the documentation + video of our tool here:

tools, Generate a CSV List From Zillow Listings that fit certain Criteria ,"""Hey there, 
 
I'm looking for someone to scrape zillow.com to find listings that fit a certain criteria. I'm looking to see when a space is listed for rent and then later the listing is removed. It is ok if a price change has happened in between these 2 events (I have attached screenshot examples of when there is a price change between the events, and when there is not a price change between these events - see screenshot 1 and 2).  
 
I want all the home addresses where the listing has been removed within the last year (it must have the criteria of previously been listed for rent). Also if the listing was listed for sale, then the listing was removed, I do not want these to populate (See screenshot 3 for this example).  
 
So again the criteria must be 1 of 2 things. 
 
1) Listed for rent, then price change (its ok if there are multiple), then listing removed 
2) Listed for rent, then listing removed 
 
I would like to see the following addresses where this criteria fits and the listing has been removed in the last year.  
 
Many of these listings will likely have ""off market"" status on zillow just an fyi 
 
I am looking for a list of these addresses for the following zip codes. 33131, 33129, 33132, 33137 and 33129""",https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Generate-CSV-List-From-Zillow-Listings-that-fit-certain-Criteria_~01aeaf1040c7ce2e10?source=rss

data, Web scraper needed to mine data from Zillow searches ,"""I need a skilled data miner and web scraper to extract data from Zillow searches for vacant land listings. 
 
The searches will look at both sold and current listings on a county-by-county basis. You'll extract the following data points: 
 
- Price

- ZIP code 
- Listed date (sold listings) 
- Sold date (sold listings)
