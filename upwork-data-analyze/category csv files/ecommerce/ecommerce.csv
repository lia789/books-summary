tools, Eccomerce Bot Developer ,"""We are looking for somebody who is able to create an automated bot for eccomerce purposes which can include price tracking and (most importantly) auto checkout from price drops. 
 
At the moment, we source mid-competition products and are able to achieve this mainly with manual methods. The products are not the most competitive products out there but will still sell quite quickly. 
 
The budget for the project is just a starting point. It would be great to build a relationship with someone and to get any nessecary updates over time. 
 
It would also be great to get some professional advice on safe using of the bot (avoiding cancellations/suspensions). 
 
The right person is simply someone who knows this area and how to do the job. 
 
When applying, please mention ""purple cow"" just to show you have read this and it's not an automated copy/paste application. 
 
We can handle payment within Upwork so both parties are protected. 
 
Before starting, it would be great to discuss the project and what is involved (for example: the site in question we want to source from). 
 
Looking for a long term relationship for any releveant future projects as well. 
 
To apply, simply let me know what you think (informally) of the above and any questions. I can give more specifics.

Milestone 2: $200 to $250 
Create an app/program that finds all the outputs that are within proximity of each other and present them in a bucketed manner. 
 
Milestone 3: $250 to $450

I need all three milestones complete before Wednesday, February 2nd.  If this work is beyond your skillset and/or you can't complete it by then, please don't apply.   
 
Those who want to be considered for Milestones 2 and 3 need to download the updated Tester File(s) and look at how I perform milestone 3 manually on the results sheet.  This is the process I need automated.  Example 3 is critical in understanding my process.  
Show your competency by creating a report for time block 61, making buckets between 23.270 and 23.320 for group 1 only..  This is a very small area of the potential full range.  Provide what you think buckets should look like for milestone 2 and 3 for the range I just mentioned.  Use a proximity of 0.003 for when a mandatory time is found.

Typically, Gird files come with about 3.6 Million outputs spread out over 300 Time Blocks.  Each Time Block has about 12,000 outputs.  Each group in a Time Block has about 4,000 outputs. So when your program searches one time block, it searches each group for matches, potentially searching up to 4,000 outputs at a time.    
When the request is to search 3 times block at once, for example, your program would be comparing 12,000 outputs per group.  """,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Build-comparison-tool_~011fde315b409f97ca?source=rss

We would like the automate this process, as well as automatically adding new websites to be scraped, as a user visits a new website. 
Objective: 
To scrape from a webpage - Webpage URL, Website name, Product title, Product Image, Product 
Price. 
 
Currently: 
We have a JSON file websites' with a dictionary of websites. 
We manually inspect each webpage and take the classname (and for some cases - for the image the child element) for each relevant div. 
These classnames are manually added to our JSON file which is then called when we run our extension. 
 
url: 'aliexpress.com' 
website: 'aliexpress' 
titleSelectors: ['.product-title'], 
imageSelectors: ['.image-view-magnifier-wrap img'], 
priceSelectors: ['.uniform-banner-box-price'], 
 
On each webpage we run our JS and loop through the 'websites' urls until we have a match with the current location.href 
When we have a match we have a function to getTextElement or getlmageElement by using the 'websites' selectors to querySelector the relevant information. 
 
What we want: 
When Trolli is active and a user is on any web page: 
- To recognise a product page (looking for relevant info - price etc) 
- Automatically scrape the ÜRL, website name (usually from URL), title, image and price from page. 
JSON file to be automatically updated when a previously unknown website is added with the info (above.)

The body text of each post. 
 
Option 1: 
 
You extract the text of each post and create a text file for each post. Then deliver all the text files in a zip file. 
 
Option 2: 
 
You extract the text of each post and put them all in one single Google Doc file. 
 
Option 3: 
 
You export each post into a WordPress site, then create a backup of all the posts so I can import it all into a new WordPress site myself. 
 
Option 4: 
 
You export each post into a new WordPress site that I will create and give you access to. 
Once all the posts are into the new WordPress site I will clean them up, add the images, and tags, etc. 
 
I'm looking for options. If you have any other suggestions please feel free to let me know. 
 
Eventually, all these blog posts have to be transferred to a new site in some way. 
 
I just don't have the time to do them all right now and my last resort will be to copy/paste each post individually and get to this when I have time.
